## Solution for Grunt 15

This teaches the student about Morse code decoding.

### To get the flag

Use online websites like https://morsecode.world/international/decoder/audio-decoder-adaptive.html to decode morse code audio.
Upload the audio file to the website and change the 'WPM' to '25' and frequency to around '525Hz'. 
Click 'Play' and wait for the message to appear.

The following should be decoded:

```
65 30 6c 55 55 31 39 4e 57 56 39 45 52 56 4e 55 53 55 35 5a 66 51 3d 3d 
```

As the above is in hexadecimal, convert it to text and the following will show:

```
e0lUU19NWV9ERVNUSU5ZfQ==
```

As the above is in base64, convert it to text and the flag will be seen.

## Flag

```
{ITS_MY_DESTINY}
```

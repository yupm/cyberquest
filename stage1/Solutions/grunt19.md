Decode it with Base64, which will give you an URL
    https://youtu.be/FghM42WZ8mk

Going to the URL will bring you to a blank video with audio that is reversed. 
Download the video with any online downloader available, for example,
    https://www.y2mate.com/en4/convert-youtube

Go to a website which can help reverse the audio, example,
    https://audiotrimmer.com/online-mp3-reverser/

Download the reversed soundtrack and play it. It will say
    /audio/grunt/data.txt

Going to this path will reveal the password.

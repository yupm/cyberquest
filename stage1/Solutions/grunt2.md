## Solution for Grunt 2

This challenge has a hidden file in the directory. The directory tryHere is just a distraction as there is nothing inside.

### To get the flag

The file is placed in the user's directory. In order to see the file, we can run the following command 

```
ls -all
```

'cat' the hidden file named .ImHere

```
cat .ImHere
```

## Flag

```
{SURRENDER_NOW}
```

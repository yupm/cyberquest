The text file has a dash infront and spacing between each word of the name.

In order to read the file using the terminal, we can use "cat" with "--" after it to 
let the terminal know that no options are being selected.

To read the file, run the following command,
    cat -- -Jessie\ was\ here
    OR
    cat -- "-Jessie was here"

## Solution for Grunt 18 #

The password is hidden somewhere on the image itself.

### To get the flag

To properly view it, we have to use an image manipulation software like GIMP or a website like
    https://pixlr.com/x/

Once the image is loaded, we have to adjust around the brightness and contrast to a certain range to be able to reveal the password.

From my testing on pixlr.com , brightness has to be around +10 to +30 while contrast is around +80 to +100.
Results may vary with different program used.

Once you have properly adjusted, the password will be on the left, around the dark green shading. However, you have to zoom in a lot as it is very tiny.
